# hello-world
my first repository
My name is miracle, a passionate learner who finds joy in learning and widening my scope. I am new to github and i am looking forward to learning great things that will help me to be more enlightened to the areas i have chosen to build myself on. I also look forward to meet like minded developers and more experienced/proffessional developers who will guide me through this journey. I love github.
